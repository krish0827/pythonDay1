The provided code stub reads two integers,a  and b , from STDIN.

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a //b . The second line should contain the result of float division, a /b .


if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c=a//b
    print(c)
    d=a/b
    print(d)


/-Performs normal division and returns a float (decimal number), even if the numbers divide evenly.
print(7 / 2)   # Output: 3.5
print(4 / 2)   # Output: 2.0

//-Performs division and rounds down (floors) the result to the nearest whole number.
print(7 // 2)  # Output: 3
print(4 // 2)  # Output: 2
print(-7 // 2) # Output: -4 (floors toward negative infinity)
